  My name is Jacob Abkes. I am an undergraduate 
  student at Iowa State University. I am currently
  enrolled in my third year of Software Engineering.
  I have also been studying the Russian language throughout
  my enrollment at Iowa State. I plan to graduate in the fall of 2022.

<p align = "left">
  I have recentley worked as a undergraduate researcher under
  Dr. Janesarri at Iowa State. Our focus was on applications of
  machine learning. Our main problem that we are working towards
  solving is to optimize the power consumption of a field
  surveying drone using Q-learning. This research has taught me a lot
  about the components and structure behind neural networks. Alongside this
  I have had the experience of learning new frameworks and tools such as,
  ROS, Gazebo and Tensorflow.
